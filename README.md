## üß† To-Do / Improvements

- [ ] Implement vertical velocity Kalman fusion (MPU6050 Z-axis + BMP280)  
- [ ] Add GPS and waypoint navigation  
- [ ] Telemetry feedback (e.g., via Bluetooth or WiFi)  
- [ ] Mobile app integration for FPV + controls  
- [ ] Add support for auto-takeoff and landing

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Upload the code to your **ESP32-S3-Zero** using **Arduino IDE**.
3. Ensure proper sensor calibration before flight.
4. Connect the transmitter (linked above) and test the response.

## Notes
- Ensure that the **IMU is properly mounted** to avoid drift.
- The **PID parameters** might need tuning based on your drone's configuration.
